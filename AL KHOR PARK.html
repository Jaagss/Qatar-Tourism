<center><h1>AL KHOR PARK</h1></center>
<br><br><br>
<p><font color="FF0070"><h2>One of Qatar’s oldest and largest parks will reopen to the public this weekend after being closed for renovations since 2010.
The 240,000 square meter Al Khor park lies west of Al Khor municipality, and has undergone a QR250 million renovation.
It is being inaugurated today by the minister of the newly formed Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME).
The park now includes an aviary, a waterfall, a miniature golf course and a battery-operated train that can hold 36 people, according to a statement from the MME.
There is also a children’s play area, a basketball court, amphitheater, skating area and a museum (though it remains unclear what’s inside).
In terms of facilities, there are small cafeterias, water fountains, a restaurant, a mosque, 26 bathrooms and a parking lot with 700 spaces.
The park was scheduled to reopen in 2014, but its launch was reportedly delayed to ensure the facility was equipped with proper safety and security features – including installing a fence around a hill that overlooks the children’s play area.
