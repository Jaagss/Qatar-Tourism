<p><font color="005DFF"><h2>Al Zubara Fort was originally built by Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani in 1938 to serve as a Coast Guard station, although some utter that it was built to serve as a police station.
It was later renovated into a museum to display diverse exhibits and artworks, most especially for contemporarily topical archaeological findings.
Zubarah, also known as Al Zubarah or Az Zubarah, the town where Al Zubara Fort is situated in, is a deserted town located on the northwestern coast of the Qatari Peninsula, in the municipality of Al Shamal, which in turn, is about 105 km from Doha, the capital city and state of Qatar (The geography of both Zubarah and Al Zubara Fort are the same since the latter is located in Zubarah).
Zubarah covers an area of approximately 400 hectares and about 60 hectares inside the outer town wall, thus Zubarah being the largest archaeological site in the whole Qatari Peninsula.
