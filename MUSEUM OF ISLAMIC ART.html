<p><font color="F51D2A"><h2>The Museum of Islamic Art is a museum located on one end of the seven kilometers long Corniche in the Qatari capital, Doha.
As with the architect I. M. Pei's requirement, the museum is built on an island off an artificial projecting peninsula near the traditional dhow harbor.
A purpose-built park surrounds the edifice on the Eastern and Southern facades while 2 bridges connect the Southern front facade of the property with the main peninsula that holds the park.
The Western and Northern facades are marked by the harbor showcasing the Qatari seafaring past.
Facilities inside the 5-storied museum include temporary and permanent galleries, a gift shop, a library, a cafe, a 200-seat theater, classrooms and a restaurant.
There are prayer rooms and ablution facilities inside to cater to Muslim visitors.
External facilities that form part of the crescent shaped MIA park include walking tracks, cycling tracks, a carousel, cafes, rest rooms and boat rentals.
MIA is part of Qatar Museums Authority. Admission to the museum and park are free. The park is open 24 hours to cater to residents of the city.
